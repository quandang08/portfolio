Hi, I’m Dang Quan — but you can call me Amu.

I’m a beginner learning backend development with Java and Spring Boot. This blog is my way of writing things down as I learn — from basic APIs and databases to system design and beyond.

I’m not an expert. I still make mistakes, still search Stack Overflow daily, and still feel stuck sometimes. But I believe in learning out loud — because even small lessons can help someone else.

While backend is my main focus, I’m also curious about web technologies, software architecture, and how AI is shaping the way we build.

If you’re also learning, welcome.  
Hope something here makes your path a little easier.
